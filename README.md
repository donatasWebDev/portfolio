# Donatas Tumenas – Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

Hi! I'm Donatas, a full-stack developer focused on building fast, modern web applications with real-time features and clean architecture. I enjoy working across the stack — from responsive React frontends to scalable Node/Python backends — and I'm particularly excited about integrating AI tools like neural TTS into practical projects.

## Featured Project

### NovelVerse — Real-Time Web Novel Audiobook Streaming App

[![NovelVerse Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/o9cOABC1nu0/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9cOABC1nu0)

A full-stack application that turns web novels into audiobooks on demand. It scrapes chapters in real-time, generates natural-sounding speech using a GPU-accelerated neural TTS engine, and streams audio seamlessly over WebSockets.

**Key Features**
- On-demand scraping and real-time audio generation
- Low-latency streaming with adaptive buffering
- Secure JWT authentication and private user libraries
- Progress tracking across sessions
- Hybrid architecture combining React, Node.js, and Python services
